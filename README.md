I employed Azure Websites in collaboration with Git Bash and Terminal to create an  Azure web app, deploying it with a container on the web app. Additionally, I designed  a customized web application to meet specific project needs. Notably, I established a secure environment by creating a Key Vault and generating self-signed certificates for encryption. I effectively analyzed both self-signed and trusted certificates. Moreover, I implemented a Front Door instance, optimized WAF rule sets, configured custom WAF rules, and addressed Security Center recommendations to ensure a robust and secure application environment. My accomplishments demonstrate my proficiency in Azure, web app deployment, security analysis, and proactive maintenance.
